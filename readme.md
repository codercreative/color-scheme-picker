### The requirements:

![screenshot](images/requirements-stretch.png)

### How does the app work?

- User picks a "seed color", selects a color scheme (monochrome, complement, etc.), clicks a button to get the color scheme and the colors display in a column - including the HEX values for each color.

### Process

- Consult Figma design files
- Create draft of README file
- Create .gitignore file and check that meta tag is included
- Create Github repository
- Work on HTML, CSS and JS files
- Check final code and accessibility
- Finalize README file
- Publish live URL

### Challenges along the way

- Have problems making the options dropdown box dark
